# Implementation of SAC+AE (Yarats et al. 2020)

This repository implements SAC+AE in [Dopamine](https://github.com/google/dopamine/tree/master) ja JAX.

Environment file will be provided at a later date.

Implementation is based on the implementation of [DBC](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deep_bisim4control/tree/main) in Dopamine by (Castro et al. (2022))[https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mico].
